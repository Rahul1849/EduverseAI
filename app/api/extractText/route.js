      "Physics Part 1 - Units and Measurements": `
        Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and time. 
        Units and measurements are fundamental concepts in physics. The International System of Units (SI) 
        provides standardized units for measuring physical quantities. 
        
        Fundamental quantities include length (meter), mass (kilogram), time (second), electric current (ampere), 
        temperature (kelvin), amount of substance (mole), and luminous intensity (candela).
        
        Measurements involve precision and accuracy. Precision refers to the closeness of measurements to each other, 
        while accuracy refers to the closeness of a measurement to the true value.
        
        Significant figures are important in scientific measurements. They indicate the precision of a measurement.
        Example: If a measurement is recorded as 2.35 cm, it has three significant figures.
        
        Error analysis is crucial in physics. Every measurement has some uncertainty associated with it. 
        This uncertainty is called measurement error. Types of errors include systematic errors, random errors, 
        and gross errors. Error propagation must be considered when combining measurements.
      `,
      "Physics Part 1 - Motion in a Straight Line": `
        Motion in a straight line is one of the fundamental concepts in mechanics. When a body moves along a straight line, 
        it is said to be in rectilinear motion. The position of an object is described by its distance from a reference point.
        
        Displacement is the change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction. 
        Distance is the total path length covered by an object and is a scalar quantity.
        
        Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. It is a vector quantity. 
        Speed is the magnitude of velocity and is a scalar quantity. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
        
        Average velocity = Total displacement / Total time
        Average speed = Total distance / Total time
        
        Uniform acceleration occurs when the velocity changes by equal amounts in equal intervals of time.
        The equations of motion are:
        â€¢ v = u + at
        â€¢ s = ut + Â½atÂ²  
        â€¢ vÂ² = uÂ² + 2as
      `,
      "Physics Part 2 - Work, Energy and Power": `
        Work, energy, and power are fundamental concepts in physics. Work is done when a force causes displacement. 
        Work is calculated as W = F Ã— s Ã— cos(Î¸), where F is force, s is displacement, and Î¸ is the angle between them.
        
        Energy is the capacity to do work. Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its motion: KE = Â½mvÂ². 
        Potential energy is stored energy due to position or configuration. Gravitational potential energy is PE = mgh.
        
        Power is the rate of doing work: P = W/t. The unit of power is watt (W), which equals one joule per second.
        
        Conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
        Mechanical energy = Kinetic energy + Potential energy
        
        Work-energy theorem: The work done by the net force on a particle equals the change in its kinetic energy.
